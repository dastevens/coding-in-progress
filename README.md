## TL;DR

Coding in progress is a single page application that you can use to monitor how much of the time you are in the zone when coding.

Feel free to try the app out here: https://coding-in-progress.herokuapp.com/

## How do I use it?

Click the `Start` button when you start getting into some serious coding activity, and hit 'Stop' when you get interrupted.

Once you have accumulated some stats you can start digging into the report page.

You can adjust the settings used to calculate the reports on the third tab.

## How does it work?

Each period of activity is stored in local storage. There is no back-end to this application, all the data is stored in your browser.
